# Vkoz Note
My own two column note app. 
I preferred having paragraphs on the left but bullet points on the right. I couldn't find a note app that did this so I made my own.
Currently cannot save or export files though so if you refresh the tab or exit, all the data is removed.
Name was inspired by the League of Legends champion, Vel'koz. A champion who studies the intricacies of the physical realm.
